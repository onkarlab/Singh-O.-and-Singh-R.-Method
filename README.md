## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure precise isolation of the object and removal of the background from the original microscopic image.
2. Next, resize the image to 1280x720 pixels and set the resolution to 72 DPI.
3. Load the image, set the magnification, and input the greatest body diameter (⌀) in micrometers (μm).
4. Obtain the body diameter by plotting a line onto the widest point and measuring it.
5. Click on 'Process Image,' and the measurements will be displayed.
6. Additionally, you can log this data by clicking on 'Log Data.' A file named 'dataset.xlsx' will be saved within a folder in the Documents directory.
